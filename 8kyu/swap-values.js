// I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

// Can you figure out what's wrong here?








// MY SOLUTION

  //parament an array with 2 elements
//result : swap the elements with one another
//example: Test.assertEquals(arr[0], 2, "Failed swapping numbers")
//pseudocode: use reverse method to swap the values
swapValues = (args) => args.reverse()
